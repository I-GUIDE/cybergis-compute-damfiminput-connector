# A MPI-based HelloWorld toy model for CyberGIS-Compute V2

This repo implemented a MPI-based HelloWorld toy model for CyberGIS-Compute V2. Model developers who may want to contribute their own models to CyberGIS-Compute can use this as an example.

For end-users, an example notebook is provides for running the toy model on a HPC resource: Open with CyberGIS-Jupyter for Water (CJW) <a href="http://go.illinois.edu/cybergis-jupyter-water/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcybergis%2Fcybergis-compute-mpi-helloworld&urlpath=tree%2Fcybergis-compute-mpi-helloworld%2Fmpi-hello-world.ipynb&branch=main" target="_blank">HERE</a>
